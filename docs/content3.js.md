# File: content3.min.js

## Overview
This script is designed to parse search engine results from popular search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, and YouTube. It listens for messages from the Chrome runtime to fetch search results, parses the content, and sends the parsed data back through the port.

## Functions
### sepOnWindowLoad()
- Description: Function executed when the window loads.
- Checks for the existence of the title element and initiates parsing based on the hostname of the current page.
- If the title element does not exist, it calls `bingIssueFix()` after a timeout.

### bingIssueFix()
- Description: Fixes issues related to Bing search results.
- If the current page is from Bing and there is a non-empty search input, it calls `searchFlaggedData()`.

### sepCheckTitle(titleElement)
- Description: Checks and cleans the title element.
- If the title element exists and is not empty, it checks the hostname of the current page and modifies the title text accordingly.

### searchFlaggedData(text)
- Description: Searches for flagged data in the parsed content.
- Parses the content of the current page based on the hostname and searches for flagged terms.
- If flagged data is found, it sends the parsed data through `sendSHData()`.

### sepSendData()
- Description: Sends data through the port.
- Sends a message to fetch search results.

### sendSHData(msg, url, matchedTerm, domain)
- Description: Sends search engine result data through the port.
- Sends parsed search engine result data, including the message, URL, matched term, and domain.

### sepCleanDomainName(domain)
- Description: Cleans the domain name.
- Removes protocol and www prefix from the domain name.

### sepCallWindowLoadWithTimeOut()
- Description: Calls window load with a timeout.
- Sends data and calls `sepOnWindowLoad()` after a timeout.

## Event Listeners
- `window.addEventListener('load', sepCallWindowLoadWithTimeOut, false)`: Listens for the window load event and calls `sepCallWindowLoadWithTimeOut()`.
- `sepPort.onMessage.addListener()`: Listens for messages from the port and updates `shContent` accordingly.

## Dependencies
- This script relies on the Chrome runtime to send and receive messages.
